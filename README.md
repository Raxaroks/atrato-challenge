# Atrato: Code Challenge (Full Stack Engineer)
This project [consists of solving the problem](https://atrato.notion.site/Prueba-t-cnica-Software-Engineer-0288476b5890444281e35eb0e2446f88) posed in the code challenge that Atrato's recruitment team applies to candidates for full stack developers.

The challenge consists of generating a web client (dashboard) in which a CRUD module can be used to manage users and randomly generated credit cards. Consequently, an API-REST must also be developed which can do all the data processing and can communicate both with an external API and with the web client itself.

The [original source code of the challenge](https://github.com/Sergi0Garcia/atrato-fullstack-interview) aims to be as minimalistic as possible, in order to cover as much work as possible in the time stipulated by the recruiters. Therefore, the source code of the present project seeks to complete the challenge using a stack of technologies that covers the entire software development life cycle, or failing that, covers as much as possible; which consists of:
- NestJS (backend framework for NodeJS)
- React (with TypeScript, frontend framework)
- Docker (containerization)
- Railway (deployment to cloud)
